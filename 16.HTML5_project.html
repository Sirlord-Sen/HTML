                <p>I cry hard and heavy then I make sure I am the only one who battles it with God. See I know I don’t know God personally as I should but I am really trying. I am fighting demons of masturbation within every night I am all alone in my chamber, but nobody sees that until I open my mouth. My mouth dares to open to one person far away from me. Because I know he won’t judge me for what I am or what I go through.</p>
